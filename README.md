# 🌍 Carbon Footprint Tracker

An interactive web app that helps users estimate their monthly carbon footprint based on lifestyle habits — including travel, home energy use, diet, waste, and shopping behavior.  
Built using **FastAPI**, **React**, and **Machine Learning**.

## 🧭 Categories

The app collects user data across key lifestyle areas:

| Category | Example Inputs |
|--------|----------------|
| 🚗 **Travel & Transport** | Daily travel distance, transport mode (car/bus/bike), fuel type, carpooling habits |
| 🏠 **Home Energy** | Monthly electricity usage, AC usage, renewable energy sources, number of household members |
| 🍔 **Food & Diet** | Meat & dairy consumption, vegetarian/vegan preference, locally sourced foods |
| ♻️ **Waste & Water** | Waste generation, recycling habits, water usage, composting |
| 🛍️ **Lifestyle Extras** | Shopping frequency, online orders, electronics usage, fast fashion purchase rate |

## 🧮 How It Works

### 1. **Frontend (React / Lovable)**
- Collects user inputs via sliders and dropdowns.
- Sends the data to the FastAPI backend through an API request.

### 2. **Backend (FastAPI)**
- Loads a trained ML model (`footprint_model.pkl`)
- Encodes categorical inputs
- Predicts estimated **carbon footprint (kg CO₂/month)**
- Returns the result as JSON

### 3. **Machine Learning Model**
- Regression model trained on environmental behavior data (custom or Kaggle-based)
- Uses emission factors to estimate total footprint
